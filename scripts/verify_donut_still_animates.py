"""
Verify the decorative idle animation still runs where it *should*, after the fix
that stops it running where it should not.

Why this exists
---------------
The lag fix paces the redraw loop off what the renderer actually published, so
the obvious way to "fix" the symptom by accident is to disable the animation
everywhere. That would be a silent regression: the donut is a deliberate feature.
This proves both halves of the intended behavior on a real client, through a real
terminal emulator:

  * on a normal idle chat screen the donut rows animate and CPU stays modest
  * with a full-screen overlay up (the `/resume` picker), nothing animates and
    the loop drops off animation cadence

It also confirms the slash-command palette opens and stays open (no flicker) on
the screen where a composer actually exists.
