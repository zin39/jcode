-- Current UTC-day and trailing-24h DAU dashboard.
-- Usage:
--   wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=dau.sql
--
-- Note: production `events` never got migration 0005's per-turn columns (D1
-- caps tables at 100 columns), so turn_end activity lives in `turn_details`
-- keyed by event_id. The trailing-24h tiers join through it; the today tiers
-- read the daily_active_users rollup, which is classified at insert time from
-- the full client payload.
