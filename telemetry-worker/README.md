# jcode Telemetry Worker

Cloudflare Worker that receives anonymous telemetry events from jcode.

The headline number is **Total users**: distinct, non-CI `telemetry_id`s that
ever installed jcode OR did meaningful work in it. Run it with:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=users.sql
```

## Storage architecture

Events are dual-written to two stores with different jobs:

1. **Workers Analytics Engine firehose** (`jcode_telemetry_firehose` dataset):
   every event, written first. Time-series store with no database size cap and
   ~90-day retention (adaptive sampling on reads; `index1` is the
   `telemetry_id`, so per-user sampling stays accurate). This is the primary
   store for high-volume raw analysis (`turn_end`, `session_start`,
   `onboarding_step` volume) and the safety net: telemetry keeps recording
   even when D1 is full. Column mapping lives in `FIREHOSE_SCHEMA` in
   `src/worker.js` and is **append-only** (never reorder or repurpose a
   position). Query it via the [Analytics Engine SQL API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/):
   ```bash
   # Requires an API token with Account Analytics read. Example: auth failure
   # reasons over the last 7 days (blob9=auth_provider, blob11=auth_failure_reason).
   curl -s "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/analytics_engine/sql" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_ANALYTICS_TOKEN" \
     -d "SELECT blob9 AS provider, blob11 AS reason, SUM(_sample_interval) AS n
         FROM jcode_telemetry_firehose
         WHERE blob1 = 'onboarding_step' AND blob8 = 'auth_failed'
           AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7' DAY
         GROUP BY provider, reason ORDER BY n DESC"
   ```
2. **D1** (`jcode-telemetry` database): the durable relational store for
   identity anchors (`install`, `feedback`), auth/lifecycle events, the
   `daily_active_users` rollup, and a retention-pruned raw tail of the
   high-volume events (see `RETENTION_DAYS`). All the dashboard SQL in this
   repo (`users.sql`, `dau.sql`, `health.sql`) reads D1.

### D1 size self-defense

D1 hard-caps databases at 500 MB on the free plan; at the cap every insert
500s and telemetry silently stops (June 2026: ~3 days lost). Defenses, in
order:

- The worker observes `meta.size_after` on every D1 write. Past the soft
  limit (`D1_SOFT_LIMIT_BYTES`, just above the file's high-water mark) it
  triggers an **emergency prune** (halved retention windows, rate-limited to
  one per 10 minutes per isolate) instead of waiting for the nightly cron.
- If an insert fails with a SQLITE_FULL-class error, the emergency prune runs
  immediately, bounding a June-style outage to minutes instead of days.
- The nightly cron re-checks size after the normal prune and escalates to the
  emergency prune if still over the soft limit.
- If a D1 insert still fails, the request returns `{ok, durable:false,
  firehose:true}` instead of a 500, because the event was captured in the
  firehose.
- `GET /v1/health` reports `db_size_bytes` vs the soft limit for external
  monitoring.

Note: D1 has no `VACUUM`, so the file never shrinks; deletes only free pages
internally for reuse. If bloat itself becomes the problem, rotate to a fresh
database (create new D1 DB, copy live rows, repoint `wrangler.toml`).

## Setup

1. Install wrangler: `npm install`

2. Create D1 database:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 create jcode-telemetry
   ```

3. Update `wrangler.toml` with the database ID from step 2

4. Initialize schema:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --file=schema.sql
   ```

### Migrating an existing database

If your production database was created before the latest telemetry fields were added,
apply all remote migrations:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0001_expand_events.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0002_transport_metrics.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0003_usage_expansion.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0004_telemetry_phase123.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0005_workflow_turn_telemetry.sql
```

(...and so on through the latest numbered migration; each also has an
`npm run migrate:<name>` alias, see Ops helpers below. The newest is
`migrations/0016_web_subscription_analytics.sql` / `npm run migrate:web-subscription`.)

Then redeploy the worker:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

5. Deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

6. Set up custom domain (optional): point `telemetry.jcode.dev` to the worker in Cloudflare dashboard

## Event types

CLI events (sent by jcode itself): `install`, `upgrade`, `auth_success`,
`onboarding_step`, `feedback`, `session_start`, `turn_end`, `session_end`,
`session_crash`.

### Website analytics events (migration 0016)

Sent by the beacon on `https://solosystems.dev` (and the
`https://solosystems.pages.dev` preview). The browser mints an anonymous
`visitor_id` UUID in localStorage; the worker uses it as the telemetry id and
fills in `version`/`os`/`arch` defaults, so the beacon payload can stay tiny.
Web-only fields are stored in the `web_details` table (keyed by `event_id`,
like `session_details`/`turn_details`) because `events` is near D1's
100-column cap.

- `web_pageview`: `path`, `referrer`, `visitor_id`, `utm_source`,
  `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`
- `web_cta_click`: `path`, `cta` (e.g. `plus_early_access`,
  `flagship_early_access`, `install`), `visitor_id`

### Token subscription plan events (migration 0016)

All require `account_id`; `tier` and `model` are attached where relevant
(`model` is stored in the existing generic `model_start` column).

- `subscription_login`: `account_id`, `tier`
- `subscription_activated`: `account_id`, `tier`
- `subscription_budget_exhausted`: `account_id`, `tier`, `model`
- `subscription_router_error`: `account_id`, `tier`, `model`
- `account_linked`: `telemetry_id` (the standard `id` field) + `account_id`.
  This is the analytics<->account join anchor: it ties an anonymous CLI
  `telemetry_id` to a subscription `account_id`, and is never pruned.

Web + subscription events are firehosed to the separate `jcode_web_firehose`
dataset (`FIREHOSE_WEB_SCHEMA` in `src/worker.js`, also append-only): the
main `FIREHOSE_SCHEMA` is at Analytics Engine's 20-blob/20-double capacity.
For web events `index1` is the `visitor_id`.

## What to watch for

- `session_start` far exceeding `session_end + session_crash` for multiple days
- `session_crash = 0` for long periods despite known crashes
- large `lifecycle_ids_without_install` counts
- a single telemetry ID dominating session totals (dev/test skew)
- zeroed transport totals after transport-aware releases (missing migration)
- `daily_active_users` row counts diverging from raw distinct-user checks
- headline DAU including `build_channel != 'release'` or raw event counts instead of distinct users
- headline DAU/installs including CI traffic (`is_ci = 1`); prefer the `*_noci` columns. A spike in `ci_ids_30d` / `ci_install_ids` from `health.sql` means CI runners are inflating user and install counts.

## Accuracy notes

- DAU/WAU/MAU should be distinct `telemetry_id` counts, never event counts. Heavy users and long-running agents can emit thousands of `turn_end` events in a day.
- Use `meaningful_release_active` for headline product usage. It excludes local/dev/git-checkout traffic and open/close sessions with no meaningful lifecycle activity.
- For the cleanest headline numbers, prefer the `*_noci` columns, which additionally exclude `is_ci = 1` traffic. Ephemeral CI runners mint a fresh `telemetry_id` per job, so unfiltered they look like brand-new users and installs, inflating active-user/install counts and depressing retention. The client also skips the `install` event under CI, so historical CI installs (before that ships) are the main residual source; the rollup's `last_is_ci` flag lets dashboards filter the rest. Raw events stay tagged (not dropped) so CI crash/error signal is still queryable.
- Meaningful activity is derived from `session_end`/`session_crash` **and** `turn_end` events. A `turn_end` only fires after a real user turn completes, so counting it keeps the metric accurate for users whose `session_end` is lost (process killed, machine shutdown, dropped final flush, or a session still open at UTC midnight).
- **Retention pruning**: D1 hard-caps databases at 500 MB. When the cap is hit, every insert fails with HTTP 500 and telemetry silently stops being recorded (this happened in June 2026; ~3 days of events were lost). The worker now runs a nightly cron (`scheduled` handler, see `RETENTION_DAYS` in `src/worker.js`) that prunes high-volume raw rows: `turn_end`/`session_start`/`onboarding_step` after 30 days, `upgrade` after 60, `auth_success` after 180, `session_end`/`session_crash` after 365, `web_pageview`/`subscription_router_error` after 90, `web_cta_click`/`subscription_budget_exhausted` after 365, `subscription_login` after 180. `install`, `feedback`, `subscription_activated`, and `account_linked` rows are never pruned.  Because of this, **historical user/DAU queries must read `daily_active_users`, not raw `events`** - the rollup is backfilled across full history (migration 0014) and maintained at insert time.
- **D1 100-column cap**: production `events` has 98 columns after migration 0016 and D1 refuses `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` past 100 (`too many columns`). Migration 0005's per-turn/session-cadence columns never applied to production `events`; migration 0013 moved those fields into `turn_details`/`session_details`, and migration 0016 put the web beacon fields in `web_details` for the same reason. Do not add new columns to `events`; add them to the detail tables.
- Raw events remain the source of truth within their retention windows. The `daily_active_users` table is an ingest-time rollup for cheap dashboard queries and is the durable record beyond those windows.
- The worker uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` keyed by `event_id`; rollups and detail rows are updated only when the canonical raw event insert succeeds, so client retries do not inflate counts.
- Telemetry still undercounts users who opt out (`JCODE_NO_TELEMETRY`, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, `~/.jcode/no_telemetry`) or whose network blocks telemetry, and may overcount one person using multiple machines.
