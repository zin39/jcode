//! Capability coverage: what the daemon can do versus what the SDK can reach.
//!
//! The harness API is a curated subset of the internal protocol, and that is
//! correct: 77 internal requests should not become 77 public ones. But
//! "curated" and "missing something important" look identical from inside the
//! API crate, and the gap only shows up when someone tries to build a real
//! client and finds they cannot switch models.
//!
//! So the reference clients are the specification. The TUI and desktop2 are
//! complete, shipping clients of the same daemon; every request they send is
//! by definition something a client needs. This test diffs that set against
//! the API surface and fails when an unreviewed gap appears.
//!
//! The ledger below is the reviewed answer for each one. Adding a request to
//! the TUI without deciding what it means for the API fails this test, which
//! is the point: the decision gets made deliberately, once, and is recorded
//! where the next person will find it.
