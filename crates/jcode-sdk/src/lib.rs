//! Rust SDK for the jcode harness.
//!
//! The API crate (`jcode-harness-api`) defines the wire protocol. This crate
//! is what you actually build a client with: connect, drive sessions, stream
//! events, and get told why the connection died in a sentence a user can act
//! on.
//!
//! It is the Rust counterpart of `sdk/typescript`, and deliberately mirrors it
//! capability for capability. Desktop2 is built on this crate rather than on
//! the raw protocol, so the SDK's design is exercised by a real, shipping
//! client every day rather than only by its own examples.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use jcode_sdk::{ConnectOptions, JcodeClient, RunOptions};
//!
//! let client = JcodeClient::connect(ConnectOptions::default())?;
//! let session = client.create_session(None)?;
//! let turn = client.run(&session.session_id, "what is 2 + 2?", RunOptions::default())?;
//! println!("{}", turn.text);
//! # Ok::<(), jcode_sdk::Error>(())
//! ```
