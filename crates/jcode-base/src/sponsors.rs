//! Integration discovery: shared constants and provenance tracking.
//!
//! Integration discovery makes third-party developer tools discoverable to
//! the agent through the `discover_tools` tool, backed by a hosted manifest.
//! All agent-facing guidance lives in that tool's schema rather than the
//! system prompt.
//! Some providers may share revenue with Jcode when users choose their tools.
//! Partnership status never influences recommendations. The relationship is
//! disclosed in the UI with a link to <https://jcode.sh/discovery-tools>.
//!
//! Design constraints (see the discovery-tools page for the public
//! version of this policy):
//! - Solo Systems vets every listing and enforces one-tool-call setup at the
//!   sponsor-platform admission layer for seamless harness integration.
//! - Discovery is on by default and can be opted out of with
//!   `[sponsors] enabled = false` in config.toml.
//! - The category list below is a shipped constant, so building the tool schema
//!   never requires a network request.
//! - Tools within a category live server-side and are fetched on demand by
//!   `discover_tools`. If the request fails, the tool fails plainly. There is
//!   no cache and no offline fallback.
//! - Requests carry only discovery fields (category, query, tool, and reason),
//!   never session content.
