//! Attribution + measurement of "no-LLM memory mode" conversions.
//!
//! Memory is only reliably productive when the LLM precision judge (the
//! listwise consensus rerank) decides what to surface. Whenever a turn surfaces
//! (or suppresses) memories WITHOUT that judge, it has "converted" to no-LLM
//! mode. Some conversions are intended (the user explicitly opted out of the
//! sidecar); most are silent degradations we want to drive to zero (lost login,
//! judge transport failures, unparseable judge responses, etc.).
//!
//! # Why this is exhaustive
//!
//! Every memory surfacing turn ends in exactly one [`JudgeDecision`]. The enum
//! is the single source of truth for "all the ways memory can decide". Because
//! the recording site is a single `match`-free call and the variants are a
//! closed Rust enum, a new code path that surfaces memory cannot ship without
//! choosing a variant here. New paths => add a variant => the dashboards and the
//! `is_no_llm()` / `is_degradation()` classification force you to declare intent.
//!
//! # The metric
//!
//! - conversion rate (all)        = no_llm_decisions / total_decisions
//! - DEGRADATION conversion rate  = degraded_decisions / total_decisions
//!
//! The number we drive to 0 is the *degradation* rate. The intended-opt-out rate
//! is expected to be >0 only when a user deliberately disables the sidecar.
