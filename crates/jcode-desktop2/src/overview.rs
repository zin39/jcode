//! The session overview: every live session as a card in a niri-style strip.
//!
//! Held Super zooms the window out of the conversation you are in and into
//! the space of all of them. The layout is the compositor's own overview,
//! which is the motion the author already has in his fingers: a *row* is a
//! working directory (a workspace) and a *card* is a session in it (a
//! window), so "where am I, and what else is running" reads the same way it
//! does on the desktop. A card's width tracks how much conversation the
//! session holds, so "the wide one in the jcode row" is a thing you can point
//! at and remember.
//!
//! Placement is deterministic: rows stack in first-appearance order and cards
//! run left to right in theirs. No randomness and no clock, so the same
//! session set always lays out identically. That is what stops the field from
//! reshuffling under the user's fingers between polls, and what lets the
//! whole thing be tested without a GPU.
//!
//! This module is pure. It owns the sizing, the placement, the focus, and the
//! directional navigation; the renderer and the app only consume it.
