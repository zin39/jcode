//! Keymap: winit key events to editor actions.
//!
//! desktop2 is a GUI app, so the primary contract is the **web/browser text
//! field**: Ctrl+A selects all, Ctrl+C copies, Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z undo and
//! redo, Shift+arrows extend the selection, Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown
//! walk the "tabs" (the session strip). Those are the chords a desktop user
//! already has in their hands, and violating them is a data-loss trap
//! (Ctrl+A jumping the caret, Ctrl+C killing a turn while text is selected).
//!
//! TUI/emacs chords are kept wherever they do not collide, so terminal muscle
//! memory still mostly works: Ctrl+E, Ctrl+U, Ctrl+W, Alt+B/F. Ctrl+J/K walk
//! prompts, matching the TUI's prompt navigation. Where
//! the two disagree the web binding wins and start-of-line stays reachable via
//! Home.
//!
//! Resolution is a pure function of key + modifiers, which lets [`PORTED`] act
//! as a machine-checkable table: every documented chord is asserted to really
//! resolve to its action, so the table cannot drift from the behavior.
//!
//! Like the TUI, Ctrl / Cmd (Super) / Alt are accepted interchangeably where
//! the meaning is unambiguous, because which one reaches the app depends on
//! the platform and window manager.
