//! Transcript text selection: highlighting and copying what is on screen.
//!
//! The composer has been selectable since it grew a real editor, but the
//! transcript, the part of the window a user actually wants to quote from, was
//! inert: a drag over a reply did nothing and Ctrl+C copied the composer's
//! line. This module is the missing half.
//!
//! A transcript selection cannot be a byte range the way the composer's is,
//! because the transcript is not one string. It is a list of messages, each of
//! which is a list of Parley layouts (a heading, a paragraph, a code block),
//! and only the *flattened* text of each layout exists as a string. So a
//! position here is the triple that actually identifies a character on screen:
//!
//! ```text
//! (message index, block index, byte offset within that block's text)
//! ```
//!
//! Everything else follows from ordering those triples. Highlight rectangles
//! come from the same [`parley::Selection`] geometry the composer uses, so the
//! bands line up with the glyphs by construction, and copied text is sliced
//! from the very strings the layouts were built from, so what you paste is
//! what you saw rather than the markdown source that produced it.
