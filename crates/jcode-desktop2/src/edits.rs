//! Turning an edit tool's output into a transcript card.
//!
//! A tool call shows as one live line that disappears when the call ends, which
//! is right for `bash` or `read`: the work is transient. An *edit* is not
//! transient. It changed the user's files, and the record of what changed is
//! the single most important thing the agent produced in that step. So edits
//! get their own permanent card in the transcript: the intent the model wrote
//! ("why"), the file it touched ("where"), and the added and removed lines
//! ("what").
//!
//! The diff is recovered from the tool's own output rather than recomputed
//! here: every edit tool already prints `42- old` / `42+ new` lines, and
//! parsing what the agent actually reported cannot drift from what it did.

/// A completed edit, ready to be pushed into the transcript.
