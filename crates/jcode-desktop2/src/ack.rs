//! Delivery state for the user's own messages, and the wiggle that reports it.
//!
//! A message typed into this app is not sent to the agent directly: it goes
//! down a socket, through the bridge, into the daemon, and only then into the
//! session's queue. Every one of those hops can be slow (a reconnect, a busy
//! agent, a daemon mid-rebuild), and until the reply's first token arrives the
//! UI has no proof the message landed at all. "It is on screen" and "the agent
//! has it" are different facts, and conflating them is what makes a stalled
//! turn indistinguishable from a dropped message.
//!
//! So a user message carries a [`Delivery`]: `Queued` while this window is
//! holding it back (the agent is mid-turn, and the daemon rejects a second
//! message outright), `Sent` the moment it leaves the composer, `Acked` when
//! the daemon confirms the agent took it (`ApiEvent::MessageAccepted`). The
//! difference is shown two ways: a pending card is drawn in a fainter tone
//! (the *state*), and a short damped wiggle of the card reports the
//! acknowledgement (the *transition*). Motion is what the eye notices without
//! looking, which is exactly the right weight for "it arrived".
//!
//! Like the rest of this app's animation, the wiggle is derived from
//! (state, now) rather than driven by a timer: a frame stays a pure function of
//! the model, and a capture can pin it by choosing the timestamp.
