//! The transcript: typed messages, rich text, and pixel-accurate geometry.
//!
//! The transcript used to be one flat `String` paginated by counting `'\n'`.
//! That was wrong in three separate ways at once, and all three were visible
//! on screen: a wrapped paragraph is taller than its newline count, so tall
//! content overflowed its region and drew straight through the composer;
//! scrolling moved by logical lines while the screen moves by pixels, so the
//! two disagreed as soon as anything wrapped; and a `String` has no structure,
//! so a user's message could only be distinguished from the model's reply by
//! prefixing it with a shell-style `>`.
//!
//! This module replaces all of that:
//!
//! - [`Message`] is the unit: who said it, and their markdown source.
//! - Markdown and LaTeX come from [`jcode_render_core`], the backend-neutral
//!   document model already shared with the TUI. Nothing about emphasis, code
//!   spans, lists, tables, or math is re-implemented here; this module only
//!   maps [`StyleRole`] onto the desktop theme and Parley font attributes.
//! - Geometry is measured, never estimated: every message is laid out by
//!   Parley and reports a real height in logical units, so scrolling is in
//!   pixels and the visible window is found by walking measured blocks.
