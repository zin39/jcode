//! Scroll feel, measured instead of felt.
//!
//! "The scrollwheel feels wrong" is the least actionable bug report in this
//! codebase, and the one that keeps coming back: the constants in
//! [`crate::scroll`] were each tuned against somebody's impression of one
//! gesture on one machine, so tightening one of them silently loosens another.
//! [`crate::stream_bench`] fixed the same problem for streaming by replaying a
//! scripted stream through the real per-frame work; this does it for input.
//!
//! The replay is faithful to the event loop: wheel and trackpad events are fed
//! through the same `App` handlers the window uses, then each simulated frame
//! runs the `RedrawRequested` body (advance the smoothing, apply momentum,
//! measure the frame, build the scene) and records where the view was actually
//! drawn. Time is simulated, so every *quality* number below is exact on any
//! machine; only the microsecond costs vary.
//!
//! What the numbers are for, in the order they matter to the hand:
//!
//! - **latency**: frames between the event and the first pixel of movement. A
//!   scroll that answers late reads as a heavy page no matter how pretty the
//!   ease is.
//! - **tracking error**: during a trackpad drag, how far the drawn view is
//!   from the finger's own travel. A trackpad is a position input: anything
//!   other than 1:1 while the fingers are down is the page fighting the hand.
//! - **travel ratio**: total drawn travel over total input travel. Above 1 for
//!   a *drag* means momentum is being integrated on top of the finger's own
//!   deltas, which is the double-count bug that keeps reappearing.
//! - **reversals**: frames that moved against the gesture. Any is a visible
//!   stutter, and the exponential lag plus a fling can produce them.
//! - **jerk**: the third derivative of position, peak over the gesture. This
//!   is what separates a glide from a sequence of teleports, and it is the
//!   number a notch-per-line wheel fails.
//! - **wasted frames**: frames that repainted without moving the view, and
//!   frames that re-laid out text while merely scrolling. Both are cost with
//!   nothing on screen to show for it.
